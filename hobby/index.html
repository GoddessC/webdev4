		<p>
			In America, the term is used to denote a zealous fan, usually of anime and/or manga. <br> <br>
			When dealing with Japanese people, however, it may be best to keep in mind the modern Japanese image of an otaku --Someone who only leaves their home to eat or shop, if at all, with an overwhelming and unhealthy obsession about something.	<br><br>

			I was raised on anime like "Bastard!, Berserk, Dragon Ball (Z), X, and Fist of The North Star" (to name a few), so it's only natural that I evolved into a high-level Otaku (in the softer connotation). If I have spare time...which I never truly have...I enjoy it by watching newly recommended anime, reading manga of already completed anime, or submerging myself in the Japanese culture. I do have a life though. Somehow. I prefer sub to dub due to the facts that American voices just don't flow right.
